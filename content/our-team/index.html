            <h2>Hyper</h2>
            <h3>The Shutter-Cat Coordinator</h3>
            <p>
              Meet Hyper, the orange cat and co-founder behind the Shutterpaws vision! Usually found with a camera glued
              to his paws, Hyper serves as our official Shutter-Cat Coordinator. When he isn't busy dreaming up our next
              photogenic hangout, he's traveling the circuit as a staff photographer for multiple furry conventions. For
              Hyper, it's all about finding that perfect angle and making sure the community looks as vibrant on camera
              as it feels in person.

            <h2>Rory</h2>
            <h3>Chief of the Mossy Lens</h3>
            <p>
              Then there's Rory, our co-founding red panda with a knack for bringing people together. Rory comes from a
              non-profit background, which basically means they're a pro at the "heart" side of things—building
              inclusive spaces and making sure everyone feels like they belong. While Hyper is framing the shot, Rory is
              focused on the community behind the lens, using their experience to turn every Shutterpaws event into a
              welcoming, tight-knit experience for everyone who joins.

            <h2>Zayre</h2>
            <h3>Code Fox</h3>
            <p>
              Zayre is an experienced event coordinator from the DMV region,
              having created the successful DC FurRide and assited in events
              including the DC Cherry Blossom Takeover. In addition to helping
              plan and coordinate events with Shutterpaws, he oversees
              outgoing communications with community partners and attendees
              and manages event finances to ensure Shutterpaws' ability to
              continue to run exciting events in the future.

            <h2>Yivishta</h2>
            <h3>Head Chaos Maker</h3>
            <p>
              Meet Yivishta, our resident fox-of-all-trades who wouldn't know what to do with a camera if it hit him in
              the muzzle. He's basically the "random helper" who drifts around doing whatever needs doing—whether that's
              wrangling a crowd, fixing a rogue snack table, or just standing there so we don't look understaffed. While
              the rest of the team is busy being "artistic" and squinting through viewfinders, Yivishta is our chaotic
              safety net, handling all the weird, unglamorous stuff that keeps the event from turning into a total
              disaster. He's just a fox doing things, and honestly, we'd probably be lost (or at least very hungry and
              disorganized) without him.

            <h3>Chief Shiny-Catcher</h3>
            <p>
              Every team needs someone with an eye for the details—and maybe a few shiny objects! Meet Kuvo, our
              resident crow and official Chief Shiny-Catcher. Kuvo is all about the "sparkle" of Shutterpaws, whether
              he's keeping an eye on the gear, perfecting the lighting, or just making sure the best moments of an event
              don't fly under the radar. If it's bright, cool, or a little bit fancy, Kuvo has probably already spotted
              it and brought it back to the nest to make sure our events stay top-tier.
